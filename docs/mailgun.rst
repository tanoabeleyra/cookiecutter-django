If your email server used to send email isn't configured properly (Mailgun by default),
attempting to send an email will cause an Internal Server Error.

This may happen just after you've setup your Mailgun account, which is running in a
sandbox subdomain by default. Either add your email to the list of authorized recipients
or verify your domain.
